# Who am I now

My interest for mathematical research stems from my curiosity of understanding the systems and structures that make up the world as well as the intellectual satisfaction of understanding the high abstractions of mathematics. However I do believe that the most prosperous discoveries and innovations of mathematics are those that connect deep insights and applicability. This is why I want to have a focus on applications of mathematics; or more specifically I want to further investigate machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning and the opportunities it unveils. 

In general machine learning promises to solve some of the biggest challenges in the world and unlock the potential of artificial intelligence. I am generally interested in the application domain and theoretical aspects of this. Theoretically this can be seen mostly as statistics, but the usage is very different from standard statistics.
