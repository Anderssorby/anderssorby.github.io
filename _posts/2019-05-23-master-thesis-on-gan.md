# Master thesis on GAN

Currently I'm writing my master thesis on Generative Adversarial Networks. This is a exciting technology that has been pushing the boundaries of AI and of what is conceived possible.

I started to write my projet thesis on several techniques and theortical insights involving neural networks. It can be seen [here](/files/ProsjektoppgaveH18.pdf).

I will update this with my master thesis later.
