# Fumbling with Functional Programming

I love functional programming. It's just much more beautiful than imperative programming.
The down sides usually comes from wanting things done and access to public libraries.
I will argue here why FP is worth the effort and reflect around some of the issues in the communities.

For many programmers functional programming can be seen as nothing more than a curiosity.
After all, you can seemingly do the same things with imperative languages like Java or C++.
Functional programming is a paradigm first and foremost; not restricted to particular languages.
Instead of just making "code that works" you should try to emulate the pure mathematical structure
lurking behind every problem. This is not something that comes for free. You have to really understand the problem, but then you can write particularly elegant solutions that you can trust.

To be continued...
